## Project Overview

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Terra grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
    - Notifi aims to be the communication mesh that bridges projects in web3 with users in the real world by providing a deeply integrated and straightforward messaging experience. 
- A brief description of your project.
    - Getting constant push notifications from your email, messages, social media platforms, and every other app can be overwhelming. With the explosion of a new generation of blockchain projects and the eventual mass adoption by the public in the banking (Defi & Payments), NFTs, and the gaming industry, the average consumer will need a new web3 ready notification experience to track and manage all their blockchain activity. 
    - Notifi aims to provide a simple entry point into the customer messaging world to help these projects avoid these unnecessary complexities. Developers will get worldwide connectivity by interacting with Notifi and getting additional fanout channels as we expand our platform. 
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Terra.
    -We want to be the messaging layer for the Terra Ecosystem of Projects and Users.  
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
    -We are a team of builders who have spent considerable time in the messaging & observability space and have had the opportunity to launch these services for cloud providers such as Oracle Cloud and AWS. We see an exciting opportunity to build out the next layer service for web3 and help accelerate the adoption of the general public to projects.  

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
    - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Terra landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    -Defi 
    -Gaming
    -Governance 
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
    -Dapps and their developers 
    -Users of Dapps
    -Wallet 
- What need(s) does your project meet?
    -Community Support + Funding  
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Terra ecosystem?
    -Valkryie (Terra)
    -EPNS (ETH)
    -XMTP 
    -Dialect (SOL)

## Development Status

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or RFP (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from Terra
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Terra. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding *needs to be below $30k for initial grants* and $100k for follow-up grants. (e.g. 12,000 USD). This and the costs for each milestone need to be in USD; if the grant is paid out in Luna, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Terra Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 2
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD
